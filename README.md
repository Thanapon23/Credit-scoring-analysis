### Project Conclusion
According to the table, the data analysis results in a total of 7 grades (A-G). When selecting the cutoff for each grade, it will yield the following outcomes:

The number of approved applicants.
The number of rejected applicants.
The approval rate compared to the entire dataset.
Calculating the Good/Bad classification and determining the Bad rate.
For example, if Grade A is chosen, it means approving a total of 10,817 applicants and rejecting 21,764 applicants, which accounts for 33.20% of the total. Within this group, there are 10,426 classified as "Good" and 391 as "Bad," resulting in a 3.61% Bad rate.

The results of the analysis can be discussed with relevant business stakeholders, and it represents a form of data-driven decision-making. This will help the business make precise decisions and have data that can be referenced.
